EuroAvionics is a leading manufacturer of Situational Awareness and Mission Management Systems, designs, produces, and markets certified avionics systems that interface with a wide range of third-party avionics and sensors. During the summer of 2017, I worked as a software engineer in their Sarasota, Florida branch.

Working with EuroAvionics has been one of the most challenging and rewarding experience thus far. As a software engineering intern, I was tasked to develop a full stack data acquisition and monitoring system to be used on airborne vehicles. My work involved working closely with the Linux Kernel to communicate through SMS, WLAN, and LTE in addition to using several network protocols to communicate with servers and aircraft systems. Some of the core components of our system included a front-end containing configuration options, Java back-end to store data, and modules to interface with custom aircraft hardware. Ensuring that the whole system worked in a cohesive manner challenged me to make design choices that fulfilled all necessary requirements while keeping code structured and organized.

Working here over the summer was a fantastic opportunity and it made me realize how I could apply my skills to a diverse range of fields.
