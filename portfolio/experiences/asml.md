ASML is a Dutch company and currently the largest supplier in the world of photolithography systems for the semiconductor industry. The company manufactures machines for the production of integrated circuits. During the summer of 2016, I was working as an engineering intern in their Wilton, Connecticut office.

Working at ASML challenged me to adapt. During my three month internship, I was required to work with a variety of data analysis tools, data acquisition tools, and hardware modules that I had never seen before. Using LabView, I created an application that enabled other engineers to quickly acquire data from a variety of different hardware modules (analog/digital IO, accelerometer sensors, temperature sensors, etc). This saved many days worth of effort since many of the machines were inside a clean room. My biggest feeling of achievement this summer was when the application I created was used to help debug a wiring issue in another machine.
