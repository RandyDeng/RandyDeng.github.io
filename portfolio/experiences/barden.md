Barden Corporation was my first work experience and one of the most unique as well. Barden Corporation is a ball bearing manufacturer that specializes in the design, manufacture, repair, and overhaul of aerospace and super precision ball bearings for safety-critical and harsh environment applications. My job involved working with a team of mechanical engineers to keep track of and update manufacturing documents. These included tasks such as updating blueprints to match current equipment, digitizing documents and blueprints, and reflecting engineering change notices on local databases. I was also asked to gather measurement data for particular ball bearings.
