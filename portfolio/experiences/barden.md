Barden Corporation was my first work experience and one of the most unique as well. Barden Corporation is a ball bearing manufacturer that specializes in the design, manufacture, repair, and overhaul of aerospace and super precision ball bearings for safety-critical and harsh environment applications. While at Barden, I worked on several tasks with a team of mechanical engineers to help keep track of and update manufacturing documents. These tasks included identifying discrepancies between blueprints with current equipment, digitizing documents and blueprints, updating engineering change notices on local databases, and gathering measurement data for specific ball bearings.
