My website allows me to express who I am as a person and also establishes myself in my own little corner of the internet. Updating my website has become a hobby of mine as it allows me to try new and emerging technologies while stimulating my creative side through web design.

My original website was made in 2016 using wordpress.com to simply hold some information on projects I completed. I wasn't good at web design at the time, but I wanted to try expanding my skill set in the front end domain. It was a rough start (and a rough website), but I had something up and running by the end of it.

In 2017, I decided to host a new personal website on GitHub to facilitate easier and faster updates. The new website would allow me to improve the design of my website and host it with my own domain name. To accomplish this, I learned basic front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap.

In 2019, I decided to do another overhaul after discovering Jekyll, SCSS, and Markdown. This time I had 3 main goals: migrate to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for its templating features, migrate from CSS to SCSS to better organize my code, and start using Markdown for some of my pages. These changes allowed my website to be more flexible, easier to update, and mobile-friendly.

This website was created using HTML, CSS/SCSS, Jekyll, some Markdown, and minimal JavaScript.
