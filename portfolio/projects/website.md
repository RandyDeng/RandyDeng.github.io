My website is here to primarily showcase who I am as a person and act as an interactive resume of sorts. It allows me to express my values and thoughts and establish myself in my own little corner of the internet.

My original website was made in 2016 using wordpress.com to simply hold some information on projects I completed. I wasn't good at web design at the time, but I wanted to try expanding my skill set in the front-end domain. It was a rough start (and a rough website), but I had something up and running by the end of it.

In 2017, I decided to host a new personal website on GitHub to facilitate easier and faster updates. I wanted my own domain name and was still dissatisfied with how my old website ended up so I thought this would be a good chance to try doing things myself. One thing spiraled into another and I learned HTML, CSS, and some basic Javascript in my quest to design something I liked. At the time, I was still heavily relying on Bootstrap templates due to my inexperience and had a lot to learn in terms of optimizing user experience.

In 2019 I decided to do another overhaul after discovering some new technologies and frameworks. At this point, updating my website is a hobby of mine and I find it enjoyable to experiment with new frameworks and technologies available for static websites. This time I had 3 main goals: migrate to Jekyll, which is GitHub's static site generator, migrate from CSS to SCSS to make my code more modular and clean, and completely stop relying on templates. I quickly begin cleaning up and removing a lot of the HTML that I used to write from scratch in favor of Jekylls templating and inheritance features. I also began using custom SCSS instead of templates due to improved readability and expanded functionality. The result is the website you see here today!

This website was created using HTML, CSS/SCSS, Jekyll, some Markdown, and minimal JavaScript.
