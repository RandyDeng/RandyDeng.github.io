title: Missile Command

---

Missile Command is a well-known classic arcade game that involves protecting cities by shooting incoming missiles. I implemented this using an [Mbed kit](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14458) and online mbed C++ compiler. Working on this project forced me to further develop my memory allocation and hardware debugging skills. I used a linked list to keep track of all player and enemy missiles on the screen, which required me to ensure that all of my data structures are properly stored and had enough space allocated. Additionally, as with any embedded project, good wire management and organization was essential for smooth hardware debugging. The game featured multiple levels, multi-colored explosions, retro sound effects, high score rankings, level skipping, and more.
