title: VIP Flapping Wing Research

---

Vertically Integrated Projects (VIP) is a program that allows undergraduate students earn academic credits, while faculty and graduate students benefit from the design efforts of their teams. As part of the RoboSense subteam, I worked together with two other students on designing and testing a miniature wing for use on a blimp. The wings total weight could not exceed 5 grams  and needed to be strong enough to not break during movement. While my team members were in charge of designing the wing, I was in charge of collecting and analyzing data in Matlab. Data collection was done using a load cell and Mbed microcontroller while data analysis was done in Matlab by using a Kalman Filter to reduce noise and identify the force that the wing generates. This experience introduced me to many different technologies, including working with microcontrollers for data collection, using Matlab to perform signal analysis, and designing and 3D printing mechanical parts.
