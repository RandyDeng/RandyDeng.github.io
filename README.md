# [My Personal Website](http://randydeng.com/)

My personal website showcases my experience, values, and interests. The original website was built in September 2016 using wordpress.com to hold information on projects I completed. However, I discovered that it was difficult to update my website and express myself through WordPress.

In May 2017, I decided to host a new personal website on GitHub to facilitate easier and faster updates. I created this website using a Bootstrap framework and my self-taught HTML/CSS skills.

## Creator

This website was created by myself and the help of a lot of online resources. Big thanks to Bootstrap for getting me started with a template and all the wonderful HTML/CSS guides online. :)
