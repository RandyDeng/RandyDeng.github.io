My favorite part of being a software developer is building systems that solve problems. Through my professional experiences and projects, I've learned that solving problems requires user-centered design, innovative thinking, and clear objectives. Each of these skills allow me to focus all my efforts on the end goal without compromising design quality.

Big or small, I seek to solve problems that have an impact. I have...

- Developed cloud-related features for [Amazon AWS Kinesis](/work/amazon)
- Developed malware analysis and aggregation tools at [GTRI CIPHER](/work/gtri)
- Founded and lead [The Hive](/work/thehive), the nations largest student-run electronics makerspace
- Designed and created software for airborne vehicles at [EuroAvionics](/work/euroavionics)
- Researched machine learning classification methods to [identify nanoscale barcodes](/work/barcode)
- Completed my Bachelors and Masters in Computer Engineering at [Georgia Tech](/work/gt)

Outside of work, I enjoy stargazing, reading, and watching anime.
