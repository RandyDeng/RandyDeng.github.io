During the summer of 2018, I worked as a Software Engineering Intern on Amazon Web Services (AWS) Kinesis. AWS Kinesis allows customers to collect, process, and analyze real-time, streaming data to get timely insights and react quickly to new information. I helped develop internal scripting tools, update real-time metric dashboards, and contribute to internal documents, but my work primarily focused on developing features for measuring customer usage. My work helped support the new [enhanced fan-out](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/08/stream_data_65_faster_with_5x_higher_fan_out_using_new_kinesis_data_streams_features/) feature which greatly increases stream bandwidth. By the end of my internship, my code has been deployed internationally, affecting millions of users currently using Kinesis.

After I graduated with my Masters Degree from [Georgia Tech](/work/gt), I immediately began working full time at AWS Kinesis. During my time there I learned a variety of skills and developed both internal and external customer impacting features.
