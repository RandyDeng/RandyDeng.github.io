Georgia Tech has been an amazing journey these past four years. Through Georgia Tech's research programs, leadership opportunities, and rigorous coursework, I have been given many opportunities to develop myself as an engineer and leader. From working as a [Research Assistant at a world renown cybersecurity research facility](/work/gtri) to [conducting research using microcontrollers](/archived_work/vip) and [building cloud systems at Amazon](/work/amazon), each new activity challenged me to think of new solutions and expanded my technical skills.

After completing my undergraduate degree, I enrolled in the BS/MS program, a fast track program that allows students to get their masters degree in less time. I took courses like Dependable Distributed Systems (ECE 6102), Digital Communications (ECE 6602), and Statistical Machine Learning (ECE 6254) that exposed me to modern techniques such as Paxos' Algorithm, binary modulation schemes, and convolutional neural networks. This lead me to use machine learning to [identify nanoscale barcode images](/work/barcode).

Outside of my academics, I became a leader in multiple organizations including president of [The Hive](/work/thehive), president of Astronomy Club, and vice president of Eta Kappa Nu (HKN). These experiences pushed me to take on new responsibility and allowed me to give back to the community that helped me get this far.

Even after my time at Georgia Tech, I am confident that the skills I have acquired during my time here will assist me in my future endeavors. <span style="color:#B3A369">Go Jackets!</span>
