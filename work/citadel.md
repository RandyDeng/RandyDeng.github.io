On March 2022, I decided to further challenge myself by joining Citadel as part of their NXT program. Citadel is a multinational hedge fund and financial services company, operating one of the largest hedge funds with more than $38 billion in assets under management (as of August 2021). Citadel Securities, the market maker side of the firm, is the largest market maker for retail and institutional clients, executing approximately 35% of all U.S.-listed retail volume.

I currently work full-time at Citadel as a Software Engineer.
