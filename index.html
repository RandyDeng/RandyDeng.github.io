                            <h2>Mandelbrot Set</h2>
                            <hr class="star-primary">

                            <h4 align="left"> What is the Mandelbrot Set? </h4>
                                <p class="small" align="left"> The Mandelbrot Set is a set of complex numbers for which a particular function does not diverge when iterated from 0 to infinity. Mandelbrot set images can be created by sampling complex numbers and determining if the result diverges. If the result diverges, the point is in the Mandelbrot Set and is colored black. Otherwise, a color of the programmers choice is used (but should vary linearly with the number of iterations). Much of its popularity can be attributed to the stunning images and fractal patterns it produces. <br> <br> </p>

                            <h4 align="left"> High Performance and Good Coding Practices </h4>
                                <p class="small" align="left"> My code was written with an emphasis on high performance and good OpenGL practices. In order to find a good balance between image quality and render time, I set a threshold of 2000 iterations to determine if a point was in the Mandelbrot Set. If this number was too high, render time would increase and the image quality would decrease. If this number was too low, the opposite would occur.
                                To further optimize performance, 16 pthreads were created to parallelize pixel calculation. OpenGL code was programmed and clearly organized to work properly with the pthreads. In addition, a zoom function was implemented to emphasize the recursive properties of the Mandelbrot Set. <br> <br> </p>

                            <h4 align="left"> Future Improvements </h4>
                                <p class="small" align="left"> Overall, the Mandelbrot Set looks amazing and render time is only a few seconds (which is several times faster than using a single thread). However, to further reduce render time, libraries such as CUDA or MPI could be used. CUDA would perform high performance parallel computing on GPUs and MPI would utilize idle cores. With OpenGL and good parallel programming skills, I hope to apply these skills on future projects that require optimized graphics. </p>

                            <h4 align="left"> LC-3b and the Simulator </h4>
                                <p class="small" align="left"> The LC-3b simulator is a C program that implements the LC-3b ISA. The purpose was to gain a thorough understanding of pipelined computer architecture and to implement a fully functional simulator. The simulator itself is a modified version of Professor Yale Patt's course at UT Austin, but the functionality of each piplined stage was coded solely myself. <br> <br> </p>
                            <h4 align="left"> Functionality and Accuracy </h4>
                                <p class="small" align="left"> The main focus of this project was functionality and accuracy. Because this is a pipelined architecture for the LC-3b, all valid instructions should do exactly as they are described to do in the ISA. This process required thorough knowledge of the ISA as well as proper organization of code. For example, the pipeline code cannot run each stage of the pipeline in parallel. Instead, the code must account for this by processing later stages first. An appendix and description of the ISA was provided, and after many hours I completed the simulator. <br> <br> </p>

                            <h4 align="left"> Simulator Results and Additional Features </h4>
                                <p class="small" align="left"> Overall, the simulator operates to a high degree of accuracy and is clearly organized for easy debugging. In the future, improvements in other parts of the architecture, such as cache and virtual memory, could result in faster execution of instructions. These additional features are easily extendible and would result in a more efficient and robust computer architecture. </p>

                            <h4 align="left"> Automating a Robot </h4>
                                <p class="small" align="left"> Designing and programming an autonomous robot was both exciting and informative. As a 5 person team, we were in charge of interfacing with the DE2Bot's motors and ultrasonic radar finders to detect and tag objects within a particular field. Object shapes ranged from foam cubes, to buckets, to even other DE2Bots. <br> <br> </p>

                            <h4 align="left"> Sensing the Arena </h4>
                                <p class="small" align="left"> What was most interesting was determining which detection algorithm to use and how to divide the work load. Instead of programming being the main focus, design choices and clear communication among team members took precedence. Our team initially decided to use occupancy grid maps to generate a map of the arena, but due to hardware limitations (e.g. memory) and time constraints, we decided to use a simpler approach that kept track of the DE2Bot's location relative to home. Objects were detected and tagged on a first come first go basis, which worked very well given our assignment. <br> <br> </p>

                            <h4 align="left"> Contribution and Success </h4>
                                <p class="small" align="left"> My individual work consisted of programming object detection and returning home. The code accounted for several issues including but not limited to errors in movement, object avoidance, and tagging immovable objects. Overall, the robot performed very well. It was able to detect and tag all 7 objects well below the time limit. </p>

                                <p class="small" align="left"> Missile Command is a well-known classic arcade game that involves protecting cities by shooting incoming missiles. To implement this, an mbed kit (consisting of an LCD screen, push buttons, accelerometer, speaker, etc) and online mbed C compiler were used. <br> <br> </p>

                            <h4 align="left"> Efficiency and Hardware </h4>
                                <p class="small" align="left"> One of the core elements of this project was to use a linked list data structure to keep track of collisions between enemy and player missiles. Programming the linked list in C meant ensuring proper allocation and freeing of memory, a skill extremely important when dealing with space and time efficiency. The other core element of this project was hardware debugging. Before programming, it was necessary to ensure all pin connections worked as intended. Depending on what kind of errors were made (if any), debugging time could range from 0 seconds to several hours. This project increased both my memory management and hardware debugging skills. <br> <br> </p>

                                <p class="small" align="left"> Vertically Integraded Projects (VIP) is a program that allows undergraduate students earn academic credits, while faculty and graduate students benefit from the design efforts of their teams. As part of the RoboSense subteam, I worked together with 2-3 other students on designing and testing a miniature wing for use on a blimp. The wings could not exceed 5 grams (for both wings) and needed to be strong enough to not break. <br> <br> </p>

                            <h4 align="left"> Wing Design and Testing </h4>
                                <p class="small" align="left"> Together with my team, we designed several wing sizes using mylar and tested thrust on each wing using a load cell. While my team members were in charge of designing the wing, I was in charge of the circuitry and thrust data collection. The data was saved as a text file and analyzed using a Kalman filter in Matlab. <br> <br> </p>

                            <h4 align="left"> Results </h4>
                                <p class="small" align="left"> Although the wing designs were not successful, it provided insight into possible future improvements and better integration with the blimp. VIP Flapping Wing is one of my older projects that exposed me to embedded systems and laid the groundwork for my future education as well. </p>

                            <h4 align="left"> what Science Research is About </h4>
                            <p class="small" align="left"> As part of the Science Research Program at Ridgefield High School, I helped analyze steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP) from different checkerboard visual stimuli. I was under the mentorship of Dr. Dean Krusienski and his PhD students at Old Dominion University. <br> <br> </p>

                            <h4 align="left"> Abstract </h4>
                            <p class="small" align="left"> A major challenge since the invention of the steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP)-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) has been improving accuracy and signal recognition. Although SSVEPs have exhibited high accuracy rates on human subjects with minimal BCI exposure, BCIs must achieve extremely high, if not 100% accuracy, to be reliable for everyday use. In this study, we examine the effect of altering the size of the checkerboard pattern on the SSVEP signal at 6Hz and 10Hz. The size of the pattern was evaluated on a continuum from a large pattern, which is equivalent to a solid flashing stimulus, to a bounded single pixel checkerboard (256x256 pixels) with the same boundary. The boundary is a 256x256 pixel square. The number of squares doubled on each edge, resulting in the following checkerboard patterns: lx1, 2x2, 4x4, 8x8, 16x16, 32x32, 64x64, 128x128, and 256x256. A Fast Fourier Transform and the power spectral density (PSD) of the SSVEP signal data was computed and plotted. In addition, a paired t-test was done between the increasing checkerboard and solid stimuli with their respective frequencies to check for any significant power difference. </p>

                                <p class="small" align="left"> Although I love what I do as an engineer, I find it increasingly important to have hobbies outisde of the technical field.

                                <p class="small" align="left"> It all started with the sunset paper I was assigned in my Solar Systems class. As I took sunset pictures every other week and observed the Sun shift across the sky, I found myself looking at the sky more often. Every time I was at a red stoplight or outside after a long day, I took a look at the sky and just observed. I observed double rainbows, sun dogs, interesting cloud formations, and other objects I would have otherwise missed. What I also observed, was other people not noticing the same things I was.<br> <br> </p>
                            
                            <h4 align="left"> The Camping Trip that Left Me in Awe </h4>
                                <p class="small" align="left"> After some time, I heard about the Astronomy Club and decided to join since I enjoyed looking at the night sky. It was when I attended the dark sky camping trip to Deerlick Astronomy Village and used the Howey rooftop observatory that I truly appreciated the stars. It was the first time I saw so many stars at once and my first time feeling so awe-inspired that I had trouble describing how I felt. The sight made me feel humble and small. Without a doubt, watching the stars with other club members was truly a unique experience.

                                <p class="small" align="left"> Looking back, I am very proud of how far I've come since I first started. Every artist was first an amateur and that definitely applied to me as well. The character proportions looked awkward and I found it difficult to see the finished picture before I started a sketch. But despite all this, I remember enjoying the struggle of creating a finished piece. Each piece I finished showed growth and was something I could proudly say I drew. Although I am not a professional by any means, I enjoy drawing. I am completely immersed while working and completely satisfied when I finish. <br> <br> </p>

                                <p class="small" align="left"> Today, I draw when time allows or when I want to make a present for my close friends. The only thing that makes me happier than completing a piece is when others enjoy it as well. Even though I can't draw as often as I used to, I am still able to find the same focus and satisfaction as before. I am happy knowing my sketches can make the people around me smile. </p>
