From short scripts to well-thought out projects, welcome to the place where I brain dump my ideas into creative writing. I'm not much of a writer to be honest, but I enjoy the flexibility and power that can be conveyed through words. There's always been a part of me that's wanted to consolidate my thoughts in one place and just share what's been going on.

This blog will consist of a bunch of articles relevant to my own life, so expect a bunch of posts related to tech or problem solving!
