                <p>The first thing you should know about me is that I love adventures. This can be as simple as
                    trying a
                    new dinner place but also as complex as planning a trip to see the total solar eclipse.
                    There's
                    nothing better than discovering something new, seeking new scenic routes to hike, and seeing
                    the
                    world with your own eyes.</p>
                <p>The second thing you should know is to always remember the first thing I said you should
                    know.

                <h2 class="title"> Optimize Learning; Stay Goal Oriented </h2>
                <p>If you improve yourself by just 1% everyday, how much will you have improved yourself by the end of a
                    year?</p>
                <p>The answer? By about 3778%.</p>
                <p>Learning is the best way to begin understanding how something works. One day, you learn about how to
                    replace tires. The next, it's doing an oil change. Then it's fixing weird sounds that your muffler
                    makes. By the end of a few weeks you'll be able to inspect and repair most issues you run into with
                    your car.</p>
                <p>To help with my learning, I make it a daily routine to update and check my task planner. Remembering
                    things is difficult (especially when you're tired and it's time to sleep), but having a task planner
                    means I can put less energy into memorizing, and more into progress.</p>

                <h2 class="title"> Work Hard, Work Smart </h2>
                <p>I am a firm believer that hard work will always pay off one way or another. Whenever I find myself
                    discouraged or complaining about some situation I think is unfair, I remind myself that my efforts
                    are better used on trying to get myself out of the situation. Often times, I find that the most
                    challenging situations I push through are the ones that are most rewarding in the end.</p>
                <p>People used to tell me to work smart, not hard. I would retort back, why not both?</p>

                        hands-on education. I also got to give a speech during the grand opening ceremony. <a
