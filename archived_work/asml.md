ASML is a Dutch company and currently the largest supplier in the world of photolithography systems for the semiconductor industry. The company manufactures machines for the production of integrated circuits. During my three month summer internship, I created a LabView application that enabled other engineers to quickly acquire data from a variety of data acquisition modules. Engineers could use the following features:

- Collect vibration/dynamics data
- Generate analog/digital waveforms
- Generate Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signals
- Read digital input/output channels
- Read multi-channel analog input
- Read AC/DC input signals

Collected data is then saved and processed using custom data analysis software. This application boosted productivity with the other engineers since many of the machines are inside clean rooms. My biggest feeling of achievement this summer is when the application was used to debug and fix an issue in another machine.
