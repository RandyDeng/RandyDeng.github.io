Missile Command is a 1980 classic arcade game that involves protecting buildings by shooting incoming missiles. I recreated Missile Command by using components in a [Mbed kit](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14458) and programming the logic using its corresponding C++ compiler.

The electrical components consisted of the following:

- 1 Mbed microcontroller to program game logic
- LCD screen to display the game in color
- 4 push buttons to move and shoot missiles
- 1 speaker to play music
- 1 SD card to store game data and files

The games features included:

- Multiple levels of increasing difficulty
- Multi-colored explosions
- Cool sound effects
- High score rankings
- Level skipping
