Vertically Integrated Projects (VIP) is a program that allows undergraduate students at Georgia Tech earn academic credits, while faculty and graduate students benefit from the design efforts of their teams. As part of the RoboSense team, I helped design and test a miniature plastic wing. Both wings are designed to be extremely lightweight (5 grams for both wings) and tested using a load cell. Connected to an Mbed microcontroller, the load cell would measure the force generated by the wing. The data was then processed in Matlab using a Kalman filter, which would identify generated force and reduce noise.

Other parts of our work included designing a test bench using Solidworks, 3D printing mechanical parts, and giving professional presentations to senior researchers.
